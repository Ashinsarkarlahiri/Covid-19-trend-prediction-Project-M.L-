# Project Overview:
# In this project I have basically executed the time-series task of forecasting Covid-19 cases by fbprohet time-series model and compared the trends across various countries:

• Performed Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and feature selection.

• Split dataset into train set and test set.

• Performed some Data Visualization using Seaborne's and Matplotlib plots like Heatmaps, Barplots, Scatter plot, Histograms, KDE plots and other plots to know data more closely.

• Trained some time-series algorithms like: AR,MA,ARIMA,SARIMAX & FBprophet model.

• Fitted the model on test set and obtained the accuracy.

• Evaluated the model performance and accuracy of each model in Forecasting Covid-19 cases trend and concluded that FBprophet algo is forecasting the best trend.
